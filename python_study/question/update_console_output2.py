line you need to add \r (â€‹character return) and end="" 
so that you do not go to the next line. Carriage return 
or \r is a very unique feature of Python.

and will keep replacing your characters one by one until it takes all the contents
left after the \r in that string. How does Carriage Return \r work in Python.
